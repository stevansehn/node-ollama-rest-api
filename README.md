# Ollama REST API

A simple Node.js project demonstrating the use of Ollama REST API with a Large Language Model (LLM) running on the local machine.

## Requisites

 - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
 - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

## Usage

1. Run the model lama3.1 in your local machine with ollama:

    ```bash
    ollama run llama3.1
    ```

2. Clone the project and navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/stevansehn/node-ollama-rest-api.git
    cd node-ollama-rest-api
    ```
3. Install packages:

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## Completion Example

### Question:

Which came first: the chicken or the egg?

### Answer:

One of the most enduring and intriguing questions of all time!

From a biological standpoint, it's difficult to say for certain which came first, but here are some arguments and insights:

**The evolutionary perspective:**

According to evolutionary theory, birds evolved from reptiles over millions of years. The first birds are believed to have emerged during the Jurassic period, around 150 million years ago. These early birds were likely small, feathered creatures that hatched from eggs laid by their reptilian ancestors.

As the evolution of birds continued, they developed characteristics such as feathers, wings, and lightweight bones. It's thought that these changes occurred gradually over many generations, with each new generation producing offspring that were slightly more adapted to their environment.

Given this framework, it's likely that birds evolved from a group of reptiles that laid eggs, rather than chickens specifically laying eggs that hatched into chickens. Therefore, in this context, the egg came before the chicken (or at least, the modern chicken).

**The genetic perspective:**

From a genetic standpoint, the question is more complex. The modern domesticated chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a distinct species that has undergone significant selective breeding over thousands of years.

Studies have shown that chickens and their close relatives, such as jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), share a common ancestor that lived around 58,000 to 100,000 years ago. This ancestral population likely had a high degree of genetic variation, which was later reduced through artificial selection in the process of domestication.

In this context, it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when the modern chicken emerged as a distinct species. However, it's clear that the process of domestication involved significant changes to the genetics of the ancestors of modern chickens.

**The answer: neither?**

So, did the egg come before the chicken, or did the chicken lay the first egg?

In a sense, the question is moot. The process of evolution and natural selection unfolded over millions of years, with many species emerging and going extinct along the way. The transition from a reptile to a bird-like creature was likely a gradual one, involving many generations of animals that laid eggs.

So, in conclusion, it's not necessarily either/or; rather, the evolution of birds and chickens involved a long process of incremental changes over millions of years, with many intermediate forms and species along the way.
